# feb_proj

Welcome to the **feb_proj**, a playful little project where we ask the age-old question: "Will you go out with me?" (because why not?) 💘

This project was created to spread some joy and give everyone a good laugh with its super cute and quirky design. It’s an interactive web page that invites you to make a choice and watch some fun animations unfold. No pressure – you can always say no, but be ready for some surprises if you do! 😉💖

### **💡 What’s Inside?**

When you visit the page, you'll be greeted with a question: *Will you go out with me?* – with a lovely little gif to set the mood. You’ll have two options:
- **Yes**: Yay! We're going out! 🥳
- **No**: You better watch out! 😜 (Things get a little tricky here!)

If you click **Yes**, the page will change to a new message and gif, and you'll see a brand new "Let's Go!" button. Hit it, and you'll see a popup with a cheeky message because life’s all about surprises, right?

If you click **No**, the button will run away from you (yes, it really will)! 🏃‍♀️ The more you try to catch it, the more random and silly the messages get. *Buckle up, it’s a wild ride!*
